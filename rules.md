# X-Team 24 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
* Disscuss and see who is best fit for it, and agree with it.  How to reassign: speak up if you are not comfortable with your task, and find who can take it from you.



## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
* Group deadlines to check in, weekly check ups as well.  COMMUNICATION IS KEY!!!


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
* Make sure to ask questions to the group.  Get opinions of teammates.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
* See communication.


## Home Rules: Pull your weight, communication, just be honest about it, nobody cares how good you are.
