# X-Team 24 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
* Disscuss and see who is best fit for it. Once there has been a good discussion, everyone has to agree with it.  
* How to reassign: speak up if you are not comfortable with your task and we can have a discussion to find who can take it and what you can do instead. 



## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
* Group deadlines to check in
* Weekly check ups through the group chat
* Leader should be checking in with each member frequently and keep everyone on schedule
* ## COMMUNICATION IS KEY!!!


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
* Make sure to ask questions to the group.  Get opinions of teammates.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
* See communication.
* Help out teammates who are struggling because we are in this together. 


## Home Rules: Pull your weight, communication, just be honest about it because nobody cares how good you are, we just care that you care about the team and our project.
